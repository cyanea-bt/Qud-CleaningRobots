## Credits

This mod was almost entirely self-made, but **A Blessed Feline** from the Caves of Qud Discord server provided the sprite used for the cleaner. Thank you!

## Changelog

### TBD, next major update
#### Version 1.1
* Re-pathed all instances of `Ava` to `Ceres`.
* Added scrapped cleaners. 3 of them are guaranteed to appear in Golgotha, and they can be repaired into dormant cleaners. They're also guaranteed to be dropped on death by cleaners themselves.
* Added dormant cleaners. You can get them through tinkering (use Psychometry or find a data disk) or by repairing a scrapped cleaner. Dormant cleaners can be deployed to create a neutral cleaner anywhere you want! It won't have any special allegiance to you, though.
* Non-hostile cleaners can now be deactivated from their context menu to turn them into dormant cleaners. The reprogrammed cleaner in Grit Gate is an exception, for obvious reasons.
* Cleaners no longer spawn lacquered.
* Cleaners are now always neutral, regardless of your robot reputation. They'll still fight back if you attack them, or attack another robot near them.
