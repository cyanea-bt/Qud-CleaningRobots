	"Title": "Cleaning Robots",
	"Description": "[b]Last tested on game version:[/b] 2.0.207.101\n\nThis is a little minimod that adds new low-level robots, called [b]cleaners[/b]. They automatically seek out messy liquids in their current zone, move to them, and clean them up with unerring precision, leaving the floor tidy and spotless.\n\nOne reprogrammed cleaner always appears in Grit Gate, with their faction allegiance set to the Barathrumites. You might occasionally find cleaners in the wild as dynamic encounters, which will be part of the robots faction instead.\n\nIf you want to set up your own roomba army, you can learn to make dormant cleaners that can be deployed anywhere! You can find the data disk like for most tinkering items, but you can also find scrapped cleaners at the bottom of Golgotha that can then be repaired and made functional again.\n\nYou can find this mod's source code on [url=https://github.com/Ilysen/CleaningRobots]GitHub[/url], under the GPL v3 license.\n\nThis mod was almost entirely self-made, but A Blessed Feline from the Caves of Qud Discord server provided the sprite used for the cleaner. Thank you!\n\n[b]Notes:[/b]\n[list]\r\n[*]By default, cleaners will mop up any puddle of impure liquid that is at 20 drams or below. You can configure this with a context menu action, allowing them to target up to 64 drams of any liquid (not just impure) or anything in between.[/list]",
